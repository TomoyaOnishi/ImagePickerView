        } label: {
            VStack {
                if pickedImage == nil {
                    Image(systemName: "camera")
                        .font(.largeTitle)
                        .foregroundColor(.purple)
                } else {
                    Image(uiImage: pickedImage!)
                        .resizable()
                        .frame(width: 66, height: 66)
                        .cornerRadius(33)
                }
            }
        }
        .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $isImagePickerViewPresented) {
            ImagePickerView(allowsEditing: true, delegate: ImagePickerView.Delegate(didCancel: {
                isImagePickerViewPresented = false
            }, didSelect: { (image) in
                isImagePickerViewPresented = false
